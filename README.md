Here is a step-by-step guide to create a Windows Command-Line Interface (CLI) application that mimics the behavior of the `touch` command in Linux (which creates empty files or updates the timestamp of existing files). I'll use Python with the `pyinstaller` package to convert the script into an executable for Windows.

### Steps to Create a CLI Application Like `touch` in Windows

#### Step 1: Install Python (if not already installed)
1. Download and install Python from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
2. During installation, check the box **"Add Python to PATH"** to ensure Python is available in the command prompt.

#### Step 2: Write the Python Script
Create a Python script that will simulate the behavior of the `touch` command. Name this script `touch.py`.

```python
import os
import argparse
from datetime import datetime

def touch(path, update_only=False):
    """
    Mimics the Linux 'touch' command.
    :param path: Path of the file to create or update.
    :param update_only: If True, only update the file timestamp.
    """
    if os.path.exists(path):
        # Update the file's modified time
        os.utime(path, None)
        print(f"Updated the timestamp of: {path}")
    elif not update_only:
        # Create an empty file
        with open(path, 'a'):
            os.utime(path, None)
        print(f"Created new file: {path}")
    else:
        print(f"File {path} does not exist and `update_only` is set to True.")

def main():
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Touch command for Windows")
    parser.add_argument("filename", type=str, help="Name of the file to create or update")
    parser.add_argument("-u", "--update-only", action="store_true", help="Only update the timestamp of the file")
    
    args = parser.parse_args()
    touch(args.filename, args.update_only)

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

#### Step 3: Test the Python Script
To test the Python script, open a terminal (CMD or PowerShell) and run:

```bash
python touch.py testfile.txt
```

This should create a new file called `testfile.txt`. Running it again will update the timestamp.

#### Step 4: Convert the Python Script to a Windows Executable
To make the script into a standalone `.exe` file, we will use the `pyinstaller` package.

1. Install `pyinstaller` using pip:

```bash
pip install pyinstaller
```

2. Convert the script into an executable:

```bash
pyinstaller --onefile touch.py
```

This will create a `dist` folder with the `touch.exe` file inside.

#### Step 5: Move the Executable to a System Path
To make the `touch` command available from anywhere in your system:

1. Copy the `touch.exe` file from the `dist` folder.
2. Paste it into a directory that is in your system's `PATH` (e.g., `C:\Windows\System32`).

#### Step 6: Use the CLI Application
Now, you can use the `touch` command from any terminal window:

```bash
touch myfile.txt
```

This will either create a new file or update the timestamp of an existing file, similar to the Linux `touch` command.

### Additional Information
- **Arguments:**
  - `-u` or `--update-only`: Update the timestamp of an existing file without creating a new file if it doesn't exist.
  
  Example:

  ```bash
  touch myfile.txt -u
  ```

This will update the file's timestamp if it exists, otherwise it will display a message saying the file does not exist.

#### Congratulations! You now have a `touch` command for Windows.

### Note:
This is a simple implementation of the `touch` command. You can enhance it with additional features like handling multiple files, error logging, etc.
